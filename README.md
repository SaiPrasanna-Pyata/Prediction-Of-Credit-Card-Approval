# Prediction-Of-Credit-Card-Approval

The objective of predicting credit card approval is to develop a model that can accurately determine whether a credit card application should be approved or rejected. This involves analyzing applicant data, such as income, credit history, and employment status, to predict the likelihood of approval based on patterns in historical decisions. The goal is to optimize the approval process, reduce risk, and ensure fairness while improving efficiency for financial institutions.
