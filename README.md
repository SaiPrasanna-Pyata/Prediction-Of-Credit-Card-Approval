# Credit-Card-Approval using Machine Learning

I Completed this project as part of my Data Science and Machine Learning Internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP).

#Objective:

The objective of predicting credit card approval is to develop a model that can accurately determine whether a credit card application should be approved or rejected. This involves analyzing applicant data, such as income, credit history, and employment status, to predict the likelihood of approval based on patterns in historical decisions. The goal is to optimize the approval process, reduce risk, and ensure fairness while improving efficiency for financial institutions.

Key Highlights:

Analyzed credit card approval predictions by evaluating applicant attributes with multiple machine learning models to enhance accuracy.

• Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the dataset and compare variables, with feature selection based on statistical significance tests.

• Applied various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Tree, Random Forest, Bagging, and Boosting.

• Compared the performance of these algorithms to identify the most effective model for predicting credit card approval.
